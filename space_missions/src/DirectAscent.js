    <h2>Direct Ascent</h2>
    <p>Direct ascent is a method of landing a spacecraft on the Moon or another planetary surface directly, without first assembling the vehicle in Earth orbit or carrying a separate landing vehicle into orbit around the target body. It was proposed as the first method to achieve a crewed lunar landing in the United States Apollo program but was rejected because it would have required developing a prohibitively large launch vehicle.</p>
