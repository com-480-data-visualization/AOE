### Exploratory Data Analysis

#### Data Pre-processing
As mentioned earlier, our datasets were predominantly clean, necessitating minimal pre-processing. The primary steps we took involved standardizing country names across the datasets to ensure consistency and reformatting certain columns to suit our analysis requirements. Now we can focus on some insightful exploratory data analysis (see more details here : [ðŸ““ Data Analysis Notebook](https://github.com/AlexleLion/AOE_Project/blob/master/notebooks/Data%20Analysis.ipynb))


#### Trends of Space Missions Over Time
A closer look at the space missions from the dawn of the Space Age reveals a sharp increase in launches up to the end of the Cold War, a direct result of the USA-USSR rivalry. Post-Cold War, there's a noticeable decline in launch frequency, indicating less geopolitical incentive. Yet, the recent rise suggests a new rise of interest, potentially due to new market players.

![Number of Space Missions Over Time](images/Missions_Over_Time.png)

Let's deep a bit further and examine the launch trends of the three foremost countries in space exploration: Kazakhstan, Russia, and the USA. The plot below illustrates the temporal trends of space missions by these top countries. Notably, the competition is quite evident with peaks and troughs aligning with significant historical periods.

For instance, Kazakhstan's peak launch activity during the Soviet era reflects its use as the primary launch site of the Soviet space program. Post-Soviet Union dissolution, we observe a decline in launch activity from Kazakhstan, correlating with Russia taking over the space missions previously launched from Kazakh territory. 

The USA shows a steady increase in launches, with periodic spikes that may correspond to specific large-scale space projects or initiatives.

#### Astronaut Selection and Backgrounds
Exploring astronaut data reveals a dominant military presence in the early years, correlating with the militaristic drive of the space race. However, the astronaut corps has diversified over time, with selection peaks possibly tied to heightened periods of space activity.

The fluctuations in astronaut selections over the years may reflect the changing pace and priorities of space exploration efforts. For instance, peaks in astronaut selections could align with periods of increased space activity or the start of new programs requiring fresh batches of astronauts. The decrease in the number of launches observed after the end of the Cold War, followed by recent increases possibly due to commercial space activities, might also influence astronaut selection trends.

#### Space Milestones

To extend our understanding of the trends in space exploration, we have added to our original dataset of space missions a comprehensive list of major milestones in space exploration. By integrating data sourced from [Encyclopedia Britannica's list of major space exploration milestones](https://www.britannica.com/science/space-exploration/Major-milestones)
, we want to draw connections between the number of missions and key historical events. This enriched dataset offers a chronological narrative that showcases the evolution of space exploration, marking the periods of heightened activity and technological breakthroughs.

In enriching our dataset with significant milestones in space exploration, the resulting bar chart sheds light on the achievements among key players in the field. The United States and Russia emerge as historical leaders, a testament to their extensive contributions during the space race era. Intriguingly, the chart reveals that newer entrants such as China and Japan are beginning to claim a share of these milestones. While the chart does not delineate the years of these achievements, we can infer from recent trends in space exploration that many of China's and Japan's milestones likely occurred in the past few years, signaling their rapid advancement and growing influence in the domain. Similarly, contributions from the European Space Agency (ESA) and commercial entities reflect the shift towards more collaborative and privatized space endeavors. This diversity marks a significant change from the Cold War era, where space milestones were primarily a competition between two superpowers. The data underscores the expansion of space exploration ambitions worldwide, promising a future where multiple nations contribute to the milestones of humanity's journey into space.

### Related work

Looking at the work done by others, we noticed that there was only one surface study of the database. Our aim is to create a history and present space exploration over the years and its evolution through the political and historical events that marked the 20th century. We want to develop a complete, structured story around the conflicts that the conquest of space has generated and developed. 
By taking a geopolitical and historical approach to the conquest of space, we aim to present a comprehensive and coherent analysis of all the players involved in the conquest of space, whether civilian or military. We'll be offering an exciting and unique data story, thanks to a detailed and in-depth analysis of these databases. 

We would like to offer data visualization with a historical focus. The best way to do this would seem to be to use a timeline showing the evolution of spacecraft, space missions from specific periods, and the main milestones of each decade.
